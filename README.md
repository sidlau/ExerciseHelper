# Exercise Helper

A Flutter application.

## Overview

This app is based on workouts developed by the Athlean-X YouTube channel.

To understand how to perform each exercise, please view these following videos:

- [Workouts A and B](https://youtu.be/vc1E5CfRfos)
- [Ab Workout](https://youtu.be/8jyhJ6TiUPA)

Perform Workouts A or B on days MWF, swapping between A and B each day (as explained in the video). The full workout set should be completed 2-3 times.

On the days you are not performing Workouts A or B, you should perform the Ab workout. This can just be done once per day.

## Downloading the App

Make sure Android Studio is installed on your computer, download these app files, and build it on your phone. 

This won't work on iPhones though. Unlucky.

## Using the App

The app is divided into three sections: Workout A, Workout B, and Ab Workout.

The app will display each exercise name and time it for 65 seconds (1 minute for the exercise and an extra 5 seconds to get ready).
Only the *advanced* exercise names will be displayed to save screen space, but I'm sure you can easily memorize what the respective beginner exercise for each of them is.

How to use:

- Click on the appropriate tab at the bottom to enter a workout
- Tap on the middle of the screen to begin the timer. Tap again to stop the timer.
- After the timer ends, a chime will play and the next exercise will be displayed on the screen
- Use the drop-down menu on the top to reset the timer or workout

## Additional Things

I would recommend performing extra pushup exercises after performing Workouts A or B to work the chest muscles some more. I personally do a few sets of Wide-arm Pushups, Staggered Pushups, and Diamond Pushups.

Also remember to keep up your protein intake. These [protein bars](https://www.amazon.com/Pure-Protein-Nutritious-Support-Variety/dp/B01126O3OY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=protein%2Bbars&qid=1587448618&sr=8-1&th=1) are cheap and taste pretty good.

### Good luck and obtain those gainz!
