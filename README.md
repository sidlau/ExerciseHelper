# Exercise Helper

A Flutter application.

## Overview

This app assists with home workouts developed by the Athlean-X YouTube channel. Equipment is not necessarily required, although a pull-up bar will help tremendously.

To understand how to perform each exercise, please **view these following videos** or else you won't know what to do:

- [Workouts A and B](https://youtu.be/vc1E5CfRfos)
- [Ab Workout](https://youtu.be/8jyhJ6TiUPA)

You will probably need to memorize these exercise names. Only the *advanced* exercise names will be displayed to save screen space, but I'm sure you can easily remember what the respective beginner exercise for each of them is.

## What to Do

Perform **Workouts A and B on days MWF**, swapping between A and B each workout day (as explained in the video). The full workout set should be completed **2-3 times** per workout day.

I highly recommend performing extra pushup exercises after each Workout A or B to work the chest muscles some more. I personally do a few sets of Wide-arm Pushups, Staggered Pushups, and Diamond Pushups.

Perform the **Ab workout on all the other days**. This can just be done **once per day**.

Perform **back conditioning exercises every day** as shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELe4fATl-Jg). You should purchase 5lb and/or 15lb resistance bands like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083GWFL1X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_pMPdFbBTS3ZC1) or use [potential alternative methods](https://youtu.be/I-XpxwHqc8g?t=141).

## Downloading the App

Method 1:
1. Download [app-release.apk](./app-release.apk) to your phone and install it

The app only works on Android phones right now. Yell at me and I might make it work for iPhones.

## Using the App

The app is divided into three sections: Workout A, Workout B, and Ab Workout.

The app will display each exercise name and time it for 65 seconds (1 minute for the exercise and an extra 5 seconds to get ready).

How to use:

1. Click on the appropriate tab at the bottom to enter a workout screen
2. Tap on the middle of the screen to begin the timer and tap again to stop the timer
3. After the timer ends, a chime will play and the next exercise will be displayed on the screen
- Use the drop-down menu on the top to reset the timer or workout
