# Exercise Helper

A Flutter application.

## Overview

This app is based on workouts developed by the Athlean-X YouTube channel.

To understand how to perform each exercise, please view these following videos or else you won't know what to do:

- [Workouts A and B](https://youtu.be/vc1E5CfRfos)
- [Ab Workout](https://youtu.be/8jyhJ6TiUPA)

Only the *advanced* exercise names will be displayed to save screen space, but I'm sure you can easily memorize what the respective beginner exercise for each of them is.

Perform Workouts A or B on days MWF, swapping between A and B each day (as explained in the video). The full workout set should be completed 2-3 times.

On the days you are not performing Workouts A or B, you should perform the Ab workout. This can just be done once per day.

## Downloading the App

Method 1:
1. Download [app-release.apk](./app-release.apk) to your phone

Method 2:
1. Download [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Connect Android phone to computer via USB (make sure USB debugging is enabled)
3. Clone ExerciseHelper directory to computer
3. cd into ExerciseHelper directory
4. Run flutter install

Don't think the app works on iPhones though but you can try at your own risk.

## Using the App

The app is divided into three sections: Workout A, Workout B, and Ab Workout.

The app will display each exercise name and time it for 65 seconds (1 minute for the exercise and an extra 5 seconds to get ready).

How to use:

- Click on the appropriate tab at the bottom to enter a workout
- Tap on the middle of the screen to begin the timer. Tap again to stop the timer.
- After the timer ends, a chime will play and the next exercise will be displayed on the screen
- Use the drop-down menu on the top to reset the timer or workout

## Additional Things

I would recommend performing extra pushup exercises after performing Workouts A or B to work the chest muscles some more. I personally do a few sets of Wide-arm Pushups, Staggered Pushups, and Diamond Pushups.

Also remember to keep up your protein intake. These [protein bars](https://www.amazon.com/Pure-Protein-Nutritious-Support-Variety/dp/B01126O3OY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=protein%2Bbars&qid=1587448618&sr=8-1&th=1) are cheap and taste pretty good.

### Good luck and obtain those gains!
