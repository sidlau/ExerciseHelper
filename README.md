# Exercise Helper

A Flutter application.

## Overview

This app assists with workouts developed by the Athlean-X YouTube channel.

To understand how to perform each exercise, please **view these following videos** or else you won't know what to do:

- [Workouts A and B](https://youtu.be/vc1E5CfRfos)
- [Ab Workout](https://youtu.be/8jyhJ6TiUPA)

You will probably need to memorize these exercise names. Only the *advanced* exercise names will be displayed to save screen space, but I'm sure you can easily remember what the respective beginner exercise for each of them is.

Perform **Workouts A and B on days MWF**, swapping between A and B each workout day (as explained in the video). The full workout set should be completed **2-3 times** per workout day.

Perform the **Ab workout on all the other days**. This can just be done **once per day**.

## Downloading the App

Method 1:
1. Download [app-release.apk](./app-release.apk) to your phone

Method 2:
1. Download [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Connect Android phone to computer via USB (make sure USB debugging is enabled)

Don't think the app works on iPhones right now. I'm working on it~

## Using the App

The app is divided into three sections: Workout A, Workout B, and Ab Workout.

The app will display each exercise name and time it for 65 seconds (1 minute for the exercise and an extra 5 seconds to get ready).

How to use:

1. Click on the appropriate tab at the bottom to enter a workout screen
2. Tap on the middle of the screen to begin the timer and tap again to stop the timer
3. After the timer ends, a chime will play and the next exercise will be displayed on the screen
- Use the drop-down menu on the top to reset the timer or workout

## Additional Exercises / Things to Note

I highly recommend **extra pushup exercises** after performing Workout A or B to work the chest muscles some more. I personally do a few sets of Wide-arm Pushups, Staggered Pushups, and Diamond Pushups.

I also highly recommend purchasing resistance bands like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W6XKRYD/ref=twister_B07W81TBZ7?th=1&psc=1) or [this](https://www.amazon.com/LETSCOM-Resistance-Exercise-Powerlifting-Exercises/dp/B07H3PJ4M4/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1OL6MV1L507WB&dchild=1&keywords=letscom%2Bresistance%2Bbands&qid=1590835773&s=sporting-goods&sprefix=letscom%2B%2Csporting%2C207&sr=1-2&th=1) to perform **[back conditioning exercises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELe4fATl-Jg)** every day of the week.

Also remember to keep up your protein intake. These [protein bars](https://www.amazon.com/Pure-Protein-Nutritious-Support-Variety/dp/B01126O3OY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=protein%2Bbars&qid=1587448618&sr=8-1&th=1) are cheap and taste pretty good. Costco sells bigger 21-bar packs at a lower price.

### Good luck and obtain those gains!
